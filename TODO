# Ideas for the future

## Bugs

* fix app/logger in-memory replacement issue - see TODO comment in Initialize method
* do we have to 'register' Initializers??? Should we be able to say Initialize if you're an Initializer
* if someone breaks the config file while things are running we should be logging the errors and not panicking

## Feature

* make rachio only a 'device' interface
* create an 'alerts' package that deals with figuring out what alert is triggered and what the alter looks like
* make pushover a 'transport'??? interface
* investigate linting on each push and not just the PR

### In progress
* Add Healthcheck - investigate `buildinfo` in logger module -- `healthcheck` branch
