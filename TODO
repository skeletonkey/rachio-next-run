# Ideas for the future

## Bugs

* fix app/logger in-memory replacement issue - see TODO comment in Initialize method

## Feature

* make rachio only a 'device' interface
* create an 'alerts' package that deals with figuring out what alert is triggered and what the alter looks like
* make pushover a 'transport'??? interface
* investigate linting on each push and not just the PR

### In progress
* Add Healthcheck - investigate `buildinfo` in logger module -- `healthcheck` branch
