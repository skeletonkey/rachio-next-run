# Ideas for the future

* make rachio only a 'device' interface
* create an 'alerts' package that deals with figuring out what alert is triggered and what the alter looks like
* allow for multiple rachio devices
* make pushover a 'transport'??? interface
* change client.go.tpl getClient to something indicating client's config
* turn logger into 'function' calls so that config updates can happen without restart
* Add Healthcheck - investigate `buildinfo` in logger module
