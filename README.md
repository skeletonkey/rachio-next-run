# Rachio Next Run Notifier

Golang program that detects your the run of your next Rachio scheduled run and notifies you. It can also notify you when the run is complete.

This exists because the author is lazy and needs to be reminder when to bypass the water softener and when to set it back.

## WARNING

This is not even at the 0.0.1 stage - do not use!
